CHANGELOG
v3.0.0:
Internal Changes:
    Implement speedups in UnifiedConsensusMaker (requires Cython)
    Bump versions for a number of packages in the environment
    Modify depth plot summary script to enable large capture sets
    Split environment up to allow different requirements for different scripts
    Atomize variants prior to countMutsPerCycle.py
    Add a verbosity work around to prevent error/warning messages from htslib via pysam
    Move VCF filtering entirely to separate script, along with masking
New Features:
    Add a clonality limit for muts_per_cycle (set at the pipeline level) to make the muts_per_cycle plot clearer.
    Add per-read N filter for SSCS
Bugfix:
    Spellcheck changelog

v2.1.5:
Bugfix/new feature?:
    Make cutadapt multicore

v2.1.4:
Bugfix:
    Fix Gene sums bug in MutationFreqFromVCF.py

v2.1.3:
Bugfix: 
    Add additional checks to the 'sample' column of the config file, to exclude characters that aren't allowed in file names.  

v2.1.2: 
Bugfix:
    Re-add pre variant calling checkpoint to fix non-functionality of rerun mode 1.
    Remove "ancient" keyword and snakemake version restriction to fix run problems on macOS X
    Fix issue in VCF generation where the same variant could appear multiple times
    
Internal Changes:
    Instead of removing families containing Ns or mononucleotide repeats in UMIs after all consensus making happened, do it before any consensus making happens.  The tagstats output removes unchanged at this time; the only difference will be in the SSCS output, which will not contain reads with UMIs that contain Ns or mononucleotide repeats (it did previously).  
    Track number of N-containing UMIs in CM_stats file.  
    Modify rerun to check for file existence (depends on OS module from Python standard library; may not work identically on all systems).

v2.1.1: 
Bugfix:
    Fix issue where masking in countmuts file was not applied correctly

v2.1.0:
Bugfix:
    Fix spelling on some rule names
New Features:
    Populate log files, add missing log files, and normalize log file names
    Add '--keep-going' to snakemake command in run script, which allows for 
        the pipeline to continue to run independent steps if one step fails; 
        rerun setup script to take advantage of this.  

v2.0.1:
Bugfix: 
Fix a bug where providing a masking bed caused the pipeline to crash at DepthSummaryCsv.py

v2.0.0:
Bugfixes:
    Add definition of negative taxIDs to report.
    Fix bed blocks issue where terminal comma would cause crashes
    Fix table formatting for countmuts and depth tables in report
    Change clustering to avoid using SNPs for clustering analysis. 
    explicitly convert report to HTML 
    Fix fastq output third line from consensusMaker
    Set quality of N bases from consensusMaker to 0
    Fix crash on non-CATG bases in the reference genome

New Features:
    Change recovery script format
    Create new test data set that can better demonstrate the BLAST filter
    Create new test reference / blastDB to match new test dataset
    Add extra tests to the test config file
    Make retrieveSummary.py work from the whole-pipeline config file 
    Reorganize BLAST control to make running without BLAST more explicit.
    Add unlock script to setup script
    Implement new depth script
    Implement VarDict
    Move the PostBlastRecovery to its own environment, allowing custom user programs without affecting the base environment.
    Create script to summarize depth based on a provided bed file
    Add the ability to select which filters the mutation frequency program applies.
    Add % mapped raw read to the summary CSV
    Add RawOnTarget to summaryCSV
    Add masking functionality 
    Change countMutsPerCycle to allow filtering out mutations based on VCF filters, and to allow for filtering of near indel variants.  Also allows for an "include" mode that includes only variants in the VCF file.  Modify Snakefile to allow this method to draw from the countmuts filtering parameters.
    Add adapter clipping 
    Add Mamba frontend to setup script.
    Add readout for % on target SSCS and DCS to summaryCSV, report.

Internal Changes: 
    Add gitignore rule to ignore user-generated recovery scripts
    Remove chrM_recovery, which is a custom recovery script from our lab
    Remove testConfig.csv, since it is created by the setup script
    Remove GATK3 from setup and Snakefile
    Add vardict-java to environment
    Modify MakeDepthPlot.R and retrieveSummary.py to point to new files.
    Add VarDict-based Muts by Read Position program (not used)
    Give final read length to MutsPerCycle, instead of initial read length.
    Remove extra environment setup rules
    Move BedParser to separate file
    Added pre-variant calling BAM filter to BED coordinates
    Make prevar file temporary.
    Add error checking to enforce number of blockStarts and blockSizes
    add str and repr methods for Bed_Line
    Add Bed_Writer functionality
    Add DepthSummaryCsv to Snakefile
    Add filter definitions to mutation frequency output and report
    Verify that a variant is consists entirely of ACGTN bases
    Change r versioning in DS_env_full
    Add a bed buffering step pre-vardict
    Add bedtools to run environment
    Change BLAST database setup and application
