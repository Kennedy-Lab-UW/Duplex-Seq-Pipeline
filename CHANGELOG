CHANGELOG
v2.0.0:
Bugfixes:
    Add definition of negative taxIDs to report.
    Fix bed blocks issue where terminal comma would cause crashes
    Fix table formating for countmuts and depth tables in report
    Change clustering to avoid using SNPs for clustering analysis. 
    explicitly convert report to HTML 
    Fix fastq output third line from consensusMaker
    Set quality of N bases from consensusMaker to 0

New Features:
    Change recovery script format
    Create new test data set that can better deomonstrate the BLAST filter
    Create new test reference / blastDB to match new test dataset
    Add extra tests to the test config file
    Make retrieveSummary.py work from the whole-pipeline config file 
    Reorganize BLAST control to make running without BLAST more explicit.
    Add unlock script to setup script
    Implement new depth script
    Implement VarDict
    Move the PostBlastRecovery to its own environment, allowing custom user programs without affecting the base environment.
    Create script to summarize depth based on a provided bed file
    Add the ability to select which filters the mutation frequency program applies.
    Add % mapped raw read to the summary CSV
    Add RawOnTarget to summaryCSV
    Add masking functionality 
    Change countMutsPerCycle to allow filtering out mutatios based on VCF filters, and to allow for filtering of near indel variants.  Also allows for an "include" mode that includes only variants in the VCF file.  Modify Snakefile to allow this method to draw from the countmuts filtering parameters.
    Add adapter clipping 
    Add Mamba frontend to setup script.

Internal Changes: 
    Add gitignore rule to ignore user-generated recovery scripts
    Remove chrM_recovery, which is a custom recovery script from our lab
    Remove testConfig.csv, since it is created by the setup script
    Remove GATK3 from setup and Snakefile
    Add vardict-java to environment
    Modify MakeDepthPlot.R and retrieveSummary.py to point to new files.
    Add VarDict-based Muts by Read Position program (not used)
    Give final read length to MutsPerCycle, instead of initial read length.
    Remove extra envirmonet setup rules
    Move BedParser to seperate file
    Added pre-variant calling BAM filter to BED coordinates
    Make prevar file temporary.
    Add error checking to enforce number of blockStarts and blockSizes
    add str and repr methods for Bed_Line
    Add Bed_Writer functionality
    Add DepthSummaryCsv to Snakefile
    Add filter definitions to mutation frequency output and report
    Verify that a variant is consists entirely of ACGTN bases
    Change r versioning in DS_env_full
    Add a bed buffering step pre-vardict
    Add bedtools to run environment

    Change the default recovery script to avoid symlinks
New Features: 
    Additional output options for the bamToCountmuts program
        Allow summing total and genes by gene or by block
        Allow outputting all, overall + genes, overall + blocks, or just overall
    Add VERSION file, and specify pipeline version in the report output.
    Get mutation counts from the VCF file, instead of directly from the BAM file
    Add ability to set maximum number of cores to use during setup.
